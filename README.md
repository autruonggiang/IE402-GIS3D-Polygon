  <img src="image/model.png" alt="model" width="1000" />
</p>

## Dependencies
- Python 3.7+
- Torch 1.7.1+
- Other required packages are summarized in `requirements.txt`.

## Data
Download the required dbtopo datasets from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ubokquibjibxqb71lduto/h?rlkey=gnex7g3gx51g06gmd1v1um9u1&dl=0) and put them in `./data_proprocessing/dbtopo/output/` folder. The folder has two datasets:
1) DBSR-46K: the `pgon_triples_geom_300_norm_df.pkl`file, a GeoDataFrame contain the DBSR-46K spatial relation prediction dataset created from DBpedia and OpenStreetMap. Each row indicates a triple from DBpedia and its subject and object are presented as a simple polygon with 300 vertices.
2) DBSR-cplx46K: the `pgon_triples_geom_300_norm_df_complex.pkl` file, a  GeoDataFrame contain the spatial relation prediction dataset. The only difference is each row's subject and object are presented as a complex polygon with 300 vertices.



## Train and Evaluation
The main code are located in `polygoncode` folder

1) `1_pgon_dbtopo.sh` do suprevised training on both DBSR-46K and DBSR-cplx46K datasets.
